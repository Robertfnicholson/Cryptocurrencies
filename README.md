# Cryptocurrencies Challenge

## Overview of Project

The project involved the use of Machine Learning. My client is an investment bank who is interested in offering a 
new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. My client requested that I create a report that includes 
what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for 
this new investment. To complete the project, I needed to preprocess the data, reduce data dimensions using PCA, 
clustering the cleaned data using K-means, and then developing visualizations for my results.  My code can be found 
in "crypto_clustering.ipynb."
